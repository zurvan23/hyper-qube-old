# Description

Trying out React by taking tic-tac-toe to the next dimension.

Extending on this React tutorial: https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe

First addition is a randomly generated grid size. I also improved styling with Tailwind CSS, changed to TSX/TypeScript, and moved to Vite to build the project.

# Use
After git clone, cd into the project folder and run `npm install`. Then run `npm run dev`.
